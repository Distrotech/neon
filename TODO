===================

Please submit feature requests to <mailto:neon@webdav.org>

For one-point-oh
----------------

40. XML body acceptance callback should check Content-Type. Should
    also pass encoding to expat if one is given (how about libxml?).
    Recent mod_dav's return XML bodies in 424 responses which need
    parsing properly.

44. Finer-grained connection status feedback, i.e., "Sent Request",
    "Got response status-line"... "Reading response body"

58. 2616 is quite strict about when to retry non-idempotent requests
    and when not to.  neon may not be compliant here.

64. Add options to only enable SSLv2 support, etc.

Longer term
-----------

2. Add proper domain support to authentication code. (requires full
   URI parsing support). Need to tell the auth layer the server
   details.

6. PUT with ranges... ne_put_range

9. DeltaV support (http://www.webdav.org/deltav/). See also the
   subversion project (http://subversion.tigris.org/) who might build
   a versioning system over DAV.

10. ACL support (http://www.webdav.org/acl/)

11. DASL support (http://www.webdav.org/dasl/). Xythos have server
    support for this (www.sharemation.com). The UI is probably the
    hardest problem here.
      => Jim Whitehead's UCI postgrad team is working on this and
    has written a DASL implementation.

14. Improved request-header manipulation... some kind of indexed table
    (a la Apache, libghttp, so we're sure we don't add the same header
    to the request twice.  Better control over adding Cache-Control
    headers would be good too.

17. Should we really be i18n'izing the low-level error messages in
    ne_request.c, ne_207.c ? It seems nice and clever to, so the user
    REALLY know what is going wrong with the server (probably), but it
    is maybe a bit frightening.

21. Storing multiple authentication "sessions" within an actual
    auth_session, so I can log into e.g. /foo/ and /bar/ (which are
    not in the same authentication domain) and switch between them
    without having to re-enter passwords all the time.

35. Allow i18n'ization if building a shared library, iff gettext
    support is on the system (and hence add -lintl or whatever to
    NEON_LIBS). If system has no gettext support, then it's probably
    impossible to support i18n in the library (although *applications*
    can support it by bundling gettext themselves). Take a look at how
    other libraries handle this.

46. Asynchronous request-dispatching? Makes integration into GUI loop
    easy... any other reasons?  Must leave existing request_dispatch
    interface intact.

50. opendir/readdir/closedir-esque interface for PROPFIND depth 1, 
    a la EZDAV. (cadaver has it already)

53. "ne_session" concept is hazy.  Abstract out a "connection" concept
    too, and allow >1 connection per-session in multi-threaded use,
    somehow.

57. Add function to map of status-code values to i18n-ized reason
    phrase.

65. Add ne_uri_copy function and use it in ne_lock_copy.  (patch
    sent to neon@webdav.org)

66. Useful for subversion/ra_dav:

    - a hook which runs *after* the response headers are read,
      but *before* the response body is read
