{"name":"Neon","tagline":"Mirror of http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon","body":"\r\nneon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C language API.\r\n\r\nMailing list: neon@lists.manyfish.co.uk || Web site: http://www.webdav.org/neon/\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: The neon API is subject to backwards-incompatible change\r\nover minor releases (0.23.x -> 0.24.x) until the 1.0.0 release, but\r\nmaintains source and binary backwards compatibility through patch\r\nreleases (0.24.0 -> 0.24.7).\r\n\r\nCurrent features:\r\n\r\n - High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods.\r\n - Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing\r\n   new methods easily.\r\n - Persistent connection support (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 aware)\r\n - Basic and digest authentication (RFC2617) (including auth-int, md5-sess)\r\n - Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)\r\n - SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate support)\r\n - Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism\r\n - XML parsing using expat or libxml (1.x or 2.x) parser\r\n - Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses\r\n - Basic HTTP/1.1 methods: GET, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS, conditional PUT\r\n - WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.\r\n - WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties (PROPPATCH), query\r\n   any set of properties (PROPFIND).\r\n - WebDAV locking support\r\n - Autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside \r\n   an application source tree.\r\n\r\nProvides lower-level interfaces to directly implement new HTTP\r\nmethods, and higher-level interfaces so that you don't have to worry\r\nabout the lower-level stuff.\r\n\r\nThe neon library source code is licensed under the GNU Library GPL;\r\nsee src/COPYING.LIB for full details.
